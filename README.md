# Paper wireframes

## Overview

- Sketch out your portfolio website & plan what you’re going to code.
- Everything can be done on paper, it doesn’t need to be fancy.
- Plan out every interaction: how people will view the pieces, how they’ll navigate, etc.
- Things the sketches should show:
  - What the homepage will look like. Is it a one page website?
  - What the header/logo will look like.
  - What the portfolio pieces will look like. Will they be on separate pages?
  - What the about section will look like. Is it in the footer? Or a separate page?
  - What the contact section will look like. Is it in the footer? Or a separate page?
